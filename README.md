# NFL Game Outcome Prediction API

A FastAPI-based application that predicts NFL game outcomes, scores, and spreads using data from the Tank01 API.

## Features

- üèà **Weekly Predictions**: Get game outcome predictions for all games in the current week
- üéØ **Individual Game Predictions**: Predict scores, spreads, and totals for specific games
- üìä **Advanced Algorithm**: Sophisticated prediction engine considering team strengths and matchups
- üîÑ **Caching**: Built-in caching for API responses to improve performance
- üìà **Team Statistics**: Access to team offensive/defensive rankings and performance data
- üöÄ **Mock Data Fallback**: Works without API key using realistic mock data
- üìù **Detailed Analysis**: Each prediction includes spreads, totals, win probabilities, and reasoning

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd NFL_data
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure your Tank01 API key:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Tank01 API key:

```env
TANK01_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

MODEL_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.6
```

### 4. Run the API

```bash
python main.py
```

The API will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### 5. Access the API

- **API Documentation**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **Alternative Docs**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:8000/health`

## Usage Examples

### Get Weekly Predictions

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/predictions/current-week
```

Response:
```json
{
  "week": 15,
  "season": 2024,
  "predictions": [
    {
      "game_id": "game_1",
      "home_team": "Kansas City Chiefs",
      "away_team": "Las Vegas Raiders",
      "predicted_scores": {
        "home_score": 28,
        "away_score": 21
      },
      "spread": {
        "value": 7,
        "formatted": "+7",
        "favorite": "home",
        "underdog": "away"
      },
      "total": {
        "value": 49,
        "formatted": "O/U 49"
      },
      "win_probability": {
        "home": 0.72,
        "away": 0.28
      },
      "game_type": "competitive",
      "key_factors": [
        "Home team has strong offense vs weak defense",
        "Divisional rivalry - expect close game"
      ],
      "confidence_score": 0.78,
      "reasoning": "Home team (Kansas City Chiefs) predicted to win 28-21. Moderate advantage for the favorite. Moderate scoring expected. Kansas City Chiefs has strong offense vs Las Vegas Raiders's weak defense. Divisional rivalry often produces unpredictable results."
    }
  ],
  "generated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
}
```

### Get Specific Game Prediction

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/predictions/game/game_1
```

### Get Current Week Games

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/games/current-week
```

## Prediction Algorithm

The prediction engine uses a sophisticated algorithm that considers:

### Team Strength Factors
- **Offensive Rankings**: Points per game and offensive efficiency
- **Defensive Rankings**: Points allowed and defensive performance
- **Team Consistency**: Performance stability and recent form
- **Historical Data**: Season-long trends and patterns

### Game Context
- **Home Field Advantage**: Standard 2.5-point home advantage
- **Divisional Games**: Rivalry intensity and familiarity
- **Matchup Analysis**: Offense vs defense strength comparisons
- **Weather Conditions**: Environmental factors (when available)

### Scoring Model
- **Base Scoring**: Team offensive and defensive averages
- **Realistic Variation**: Gaussian distribution around expected scores
- **Score Constraints**: Ensures scores stay within realistic NFL ranges (0-50)
- **Win Probability**: Logistic function converting score differences to win chances

### Game Classification
- **Close Game**: Spread ‚â§ 3 points
- **Competitive**: Spread 4-7 points
- **Moderate Blowout**: Spread 8-14 points
- **Blowout**: Spread > 14 points

## Tank01 API Integration

### Required Endpoints

The application expects these Tank01 API endpoints (you may need to adjust based on actual API documentation):

- `GET /nfl/schedule/current-week` - Current week's games
- `GET /nfl/teams/{team}/stats` - Team offensive/defensive statistics
- `GET /nfl/standings` - League standings
- `GET /nfl/schedule` - Full season schedule

### API Response Parsing

The `Tank01Client` includes parsing methods that you'll need to customize based on the actual API response format. Look for methods like:

- `_parse_schedule_data()`
- `_parse_team_stats_data()`
- `_parse_standings_data()`

### Fallback to Mock Data

If the Tank01 API is unavailable or you don't have an API key, the application will automatically use realistic mock data for demonstration purposes.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TANK01_API_KEY` | Your Tank01 API key | Required |
| `TANK01_BASE_URL` | Tank01 API base URL | `https://api.tank01.com` |
| `MODEL_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | Minimum confidence for predictions | `0.6` |
| `API_HOST` | API host address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `API_PORT` | API port | `8000` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug mode | `False` |

### Model Configuration

You can adjust the prediction algorithm by modifying:

- Team strength calculations in `prediction_engine.py`
- Home field advantage adjustments
- Scoring variation parameters
- Win probability calculations
